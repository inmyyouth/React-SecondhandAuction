# A secondhand trading platform (web) with options for auction and price negotiation                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       
Team Project(2024):
    My contributions - Backend, Frontend(excluding design)
    Development of APIs and interactive pages for product registration, product listing, and detail pages, product auction system, and user chat system

Project Concept:
    To address the seller's mindset, it's challenging to set the right price for second-hand items. So, offer them two options. The first option allows them to suggest a price and adjust it through chat. The second option is an auction, where the seller sets only the initial price, allowing others to determine the final price.

Tools and Services:
    React - The frontend library used to build the secondhand auction website
    Node.js - The backend runtime environment used to handle server-side logic
    Express.js - Web framework used to handle HTTP requests and routes
    VSCode - Used to edit code files
    MySQL - Relational database management system for user and product management

Dev Journey:
    This was my first time using React and Node.js. It was a challenging experience, but after implementing the features, everything looks fascinating. I didn’t have a clear understanding of backend server processes before, but now I have a better grasp of how websites work.☺️
